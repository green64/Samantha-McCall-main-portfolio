# Primary Portfolio

[Samantha McCall's Portfolio](https://green64.github.io)

Welcome to my boot camp portfolio. This work-in-progress site includes links to all of my projects. Alternatively, you'll find those links by visiting my main site [Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/portfolio.html).

Every project utilizes HTML and CSS. Beyond that, this list is a brief summary of what you'll find in the various projects. They're listed as they were created, so you'll definitely see the evolution of my skills as you move down the list. For more information, check out the READme for any specific project. 

*[Basic-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/) -- it all started here. We created a basic 3-page site using HTML and CSS. 

*[Bootstrap-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/) -- This project represents my first forray into Bootstrap. I love it and use it on every project now to take advantage of its easy-to-use nav bar, nesting and responsiveness.

*[Responsive-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/) -- At first glance, this looks the same as my basic portfolio. But wait! Reduce your window ... look at that responsiveness! Ahhh, the power of media queries. And it never hurts to know how to accomplish your goal in more than one way. 

*[Hangman-Game](https://green64.github.io/Hangman-Game/) -- Now things get interactive ... 

As a content writer I was always  interested in web development, and I've built websites for a long time. I started with first generation text editors, moved on to Dreamweaver, and learned to use a handful of CMS tools. Prior to now, when I wanted to use JavaScript I had to find someone else's script that was close to what I wanted. I have so much more to learn. But this project gave me the knowledge to build my own scripts. 

*[Crystals Collector](https://green64.github.io/week-4-game/) -- This guessing game utilizes jQuery to generate random numbers and assign random values to crystal images that the player clicks on to try to win the game. 

*[GIFTastic API](https://green64.github.io/GifTastic-API/) -- Welcome to the world of machine talking to machine! This app starts with preselected buttons that deliver GIPHYs from the GIPHY API. User can also enter their own search term and enjoy hours of GIPHY fun.

*[Firebase Train Schedule](https://green64.github.io/Firebase-Train-Scheduler/) -- This projects introduces backend storage to my coding repertoire via Firebase. FERN programmer? Sounds good to me!

*[Liri Node App](https://green64.github.io/Liri-Node-App/) -- This command-line app let you pull title-specific data from several popular APIs.

*[Node MYSQL App](https://green64.github.io/Node-MYSQL-app/) -- Who needs an API when you can query your own database! Welcome to the world of MYSQL.
