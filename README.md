[Samantha McCall's Portfolio](https://green64.github.io)

Welcome to my boot camp portfolio. This work-in-progress site includes links to all of my projects. You'll find those links by clicking on the portfolio link.

Every project utilizes HTML and CSS. Beyond that, this list is a brief summary of what you'll find in the various projects. They're listed as they were created, so you'll definitely see the evolution of my skills the further down the list you explore. For more information, check out the READme for any specific project. 

*[Basic-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/) -- it all started here. We created a basic 3-page site using HTML and CSS. 

*[Bootstrap-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/) -- This project represents my first forray into Bootstrap. I love it and use on every project going forward to take advantage of its easy-to-use nav bar, nesting and responsiveness.

*[Responsive-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/) -- At first glance, this looks the same as my basic portfolio. But wait! Reduce your window ... look at that responsiveness! Ahhh, the power of media queries. And it never hurts to know how to accomplish your goal in more than one way. 

*[Hangman-Game](https://green64.github.io/Hangman-Game/) -- Now things get interactive ... As a content writer whose always been interested in web development, I've built websites for a long time. I started with first generation text editors, moved on to Dreamweaver, and learned to use handful of CMS tools. Prior to now, when I wanted to use JavaScript I had to find someone else's script that was close to what I wanted. I have so much more to learn. But this project introduced me to building my own scripts. 

*[Crystals Collector](https://green64.github.io/week-4-game/) -- This guessing game utilizes jQuery to generate random numbers and assign random values to crystal images that the player clicks on to try to win the game. 

*[Trivia Game](https://green64.github.io/triviagame/) -- This game incorporates JavaSCript and the jQuery library to create a game with timed trivia questions.
