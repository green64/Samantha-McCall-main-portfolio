            <p class="section">As a redheaded, left-handed Scorpio, I was destined to do things differently. I started my career in print publishing,
                but once I learned HTML, the immediate gratification of making a correction and seeing it online in seconds
                was much better than waiting for books to come back from the printer.</p>
            <p class="section">I wish I would've done something like boot camp 10 years ago, because I'm really enjoying it. I'm eager to learn
                the skills that will enable me to shift from the marketing side of digital to the IT side. I think it'll
                still come in handy to understand SEO, cross-channel campaigns, etc. Even if you aren't actively using a
                language or skill, it's still helpful to understand the lexicon and the synergies between technologies.
            </p>
            <p class="section">When I'm not learning code I'm usually at a concert, because I love live music. The next show I have tickets
                for is a first-time festival called
                <a href="https://ntlhomecoming.com/" target="_blank">Homecoming</a> in Cincinnati that's being put on by my favorite band, The National. The two-day lineup includes:</p>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>Father John Misty</li>
                <li>Big Thief</li>
                <li>Future Islands</li>
                <li>Lord Huron</li>
                <li>Plus more bands TBA</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="section">
                It's going to be an amazing show! And if that's not enough, another band I love, The Decemberists, has a new album and tour
                coming in March. I've already got tickets to see them in May at The Uptown, which should be great too.</p>
