                        <p class="section">I didn't realize how much I've learned since January until I started updating my portfolio.
                        Sure, I've been crazy busy, fallen woefully behind on my Netflix queue and barely came up for breath to see my youngest
                        daughter graduate with honors from KU. But in terms of what-I-know-now-that-I-didn't-know-then, I've covered some serious ground! 
                        </p>
                        <p class="section">It's easy to forget amongst all the frustration, questions and assignment revamps that I've
                        learned about everything from jQuery and MVC frameworks to version control and Heroku deployments. I've had help 
                        from instructors, TAs (thanks Byron and Cameron), tutors &mdash; even my developer son-in-law Rowan has graciously answered questions. 
                        and patiently helped me debug. I've also learned to Google questions and find my own answers, which I 
                        know is an essential skill going forward. 
                         </p>
                         <p class="section">In some respects, I've only scratched the surface. But looking at my updated portfolio I see
                        twelve assignments that are indicative of just how much I've learned. For now, I know I have a great foundation, broader coding
                        skills, and merely a hint of where I'll be as a developer in another five months. Or five years ...
                        </p>
                        <p class="section text-center">~~~~~</p>
                        <p class="section">Fresh perspective. It's important to me because it's the payoff for thinking independently. My cover
                            picture is awesome, isn't it? Some far off place full of intrigue and stories ...</p>
                        <p class="section">
                            Actually, it's in Kansas City! It's a well-known landmark -- the WWI Memorial right across from Union Station. But thanks
                            to fresh perspective, it could easily be the portal to another dimension.</p>
                        <p class="section"> As a redheaded, left-handed Scorpio, I was destined to do things differently. I started my career
                            in print publishing, but once I learned HTML, the immediate gratification of making a correction
                            and seeing it online in seconds resonated with me.</p>
                        <p class="section">I love learning, so I'm very much at home in KU's coding program. With each new skill I acquire,
                            I'm more eager to make the shift from the marketing to the IT side of digital communications.
                            The experience I've already acquired -- content writing, SEO, cross-channel marketing, etc. --
                            combined with up-to-date experience in full-stack programming should dovetail nicely
                            in my future coding roles.</p>
                        <p class="section">When I'm not researching and writing code, I'm an adoring mom, a cat and all-around animal lover,
                            a die-hard alternative music fan and a semi-successful gardener. I travel whenever I can and
                            am planning my first visit to the great state of Ohio this spring to attend
                            <a href="https://ntlhomecoming.com/" target="_blank">Homecoming</a> in Cincinnati, a festival curated by my favorite band, The National.</p>
                        <p class="section">In the meantime, I'm learning something new EVERY DAY. And this work-in-progress portfolio will reflect that knowledge acquisition.</p>
