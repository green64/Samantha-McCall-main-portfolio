                        <p class="section">Maybe you noticed my blog name or even the "fp18" in my URL ... Fresh perspective is important to me 
                            because it's the payoff for thinking independently. My cover picture is awesome, isn't it? Some far-off 
                            place full of intrigue and stories ...</p>
                        <p class="section">
                            Actually, it's in Kansas City! It's a well-known landmark &mdash; the WWI Memorial right across from Union Station. But thanks
                            to fresh perspective, it could easily be the portal to another dimension.</p>
                        <p class="section"> As a redheaded, left-handed Scorpio, I was destined to do things differently. I started my career
                            in print publishing, but once I learned HTML, the immediate gratification of making a correction
                            and seeing it online in seconds resonated with me.</p>
                        <p class="section">I love learning, so I'm very much at home in KU's coding program. With each new skill I acquire,
                            I'm more eager to make the shift from the marketing to the IT side of digital communications.
                            The experience I've already acquired &mdash; content writing, SEO, cross-channel marketing, etc.
                            &mdash; combined with up-to-date experience in full-stack programming should dovetail nicely
                            in my future coding roles.</p>
                        <p class="section">When I'm not researching and writing code, I'm an adoring mom, a cat and all-around animal lover,
                            a die-hard alternative music fan and a semi-successful gardener. I travel whenever I can and
                            recently visited the beautiful city of Cincinnati, Ohio, for
                            <a class="blue" href="https://ntlhomecoming.com/" target="_blank">Homecoming</a>, a festival curated by my favorite band, The National.</p>
                        <p class="section">In the meantime, I'm learning something new EVERY DAY. This work-in-progress portfolio reflects that
                            knowledge acquisition.</p>
                            <p class="section text-center">~~~~~</p>
                        <h3 class="portlink"><span style="font-size:1em" class="fas fa-hourglass-half" aria-hidden="true"></span> May update</h3>
                        <p class="section">Since I created this portfolio in January, I've been crazy busy, fallen woefully behind on my Netflix
                            queue and barely came up for breath to see my youngest daughter graduate with honors from KU.
                            But in terms of what-I-know-now-that-I-didn't-know-then, I've covered some serious ground!</p>
                        <p class="section">It's easy to forget amongst the frustration, questions and assignment revamps that I've learned about
                            everything from jQuery and MVC frameworks to version control and Heroku deployments. I've had
                            help from instructors, TAs (thanks Byron and Cameron), tutors &mdash; even my developer son-in-law
                            Rowan has graciously answered questions and patiently helped me debug. I've also learned to Google
                            questions and find my own answers, which I know is an essential skill going forward.</p>
                        <p class="section">In some respects, I've only scratched the surface. But my updated portfolio with 12 working websites
                            and apps is indicative of how much I've learned. I have a great foundation to build on, broader
                            coding skills to experiment with, and optimism about where I'll be as a developer in five months,
                            let alone five years!</p>
                            <p class="section text-center">~~~~~</p>
                        <h3 class="portlink"><span style="font-size:1em" class="fas fa-stopwatch" aria-hidden="true"></span> June update</h3>
                        <p class="section">The days are literally flying by now! We have 10 class periods left, an enormous project to complete, 
                            and a veritable repo full of pitfalls to hopefully overcome. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="section">Of course, the learning won't stop when class ends July 12. I'm excited to be among the first class of 
                            <a class="blue" href="http://kcwomenintech.org/" target="_blank">KCWiT's new mentoring program</a>, which starts later this month. 
                            Then there are those two million bookmarks on every topic from Visual Studio shortcuts to React projects I've saved ... And hopefully, 
                            a new job where my web dev skills can help meet the need for clean, responsive websites that deliver amazing user experiences.</p>
                        <p class="section">It's not even officially summer yet, but when it comes to pursuing new development challenges it's shaping 
                            up to be a hot one!</p>
