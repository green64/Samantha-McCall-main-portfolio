                                Sixty years ago, Volkswagon's "Think Small" campaign changed the copywriter-designer
                                work model.
                                Today, digital companies are rediscovering the value of creative synergy.

                                "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."
                                &mdash; Isaac Newton

                            <p class="m-3">Isaac Newton's lifetime accomplishments earned him a spot among the
                                uppermost echelons of
                                mankind's best scientific minds. But his famous quote was his way of humbly admitting
                                it wasn't
                                mere personal brilliance that got him there. He had the work of every scientist before
                                him to draw from
                                and build upon. Even the quote wasn't wholly his; it originated in the

                                        The bottom line: Today's breakthroughs, regardless of the discipline, are
                                        reliant on the discoveries of those who came before.

                                    <p class="m-3">And so it is with UX. Advertising and user experience are
                                        fundamentally different, but they both
                                        rely on creative minds for execution. And to some extent, both use concepts
                                        grounded in psychology and sociology
                                        to select the words, images, and symbols that best resonate with their intended
                                        audience.

                                    <p class="m-3">In 1958, the DDB Agency launched an ad campaign that forever changed
                                        how copywriters and designers
                                        work together. Prior to the <a class="blue" href="https://medium.com/theagency/the-ad-that-changed-advertising-18291a67488c"
                                            target="_blank">"Think Small"</a>
                                        campaign, creatives were often siloed. After the campaign, which Advertising
                                        Age recognized as the greatest to date, copy
                                        and design working in tandem to set tone and capture readers' imaginations
                                        became the norm.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="m-3">Sixty years later, UX has grown in importance to the point
                                        user-oriented has replaced merely functional as
                                        the baseline for digital product development. Designers already play a
                                        prominent role in adding usability to digital
                                        products. But in the past few years, UX product managers like their creative
                                        director brethren before them
                                        have realized the value of bringing UX writers in at a product's inception.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 class="mx-3 pt-3 portlink">Why add writers to the UX team?</h3>
                                    <p class="m-3">Writers belong in the mix for the same reason copywriter Koenig and
                                        art director Krone's "Think Small" pairing worked:
                                        they create a more cohesive reader (or user) experience. Writers' empathy for
                                        users, combined with their understanding of design
                                        and functionality, informs the calls to action, error state messages,
                                        notification messages, onboarding instructions, and tooltip
                                        prompts users encounter in apps, websites, and microsites.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="m-3"> The contrast between these elements written by a UX writer or a
                                        team member with no specialized training can be the
                                        difference between a mediocre and great user experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 class="mx-3 pt-3 portlink">What makes a great UX writer?</h3>
                                    <p class="m-3">There's no single answer to this question. But the ability to think
                                        like a user and translate that empathy into written
                                        cues and instructions is a good start &mdash; even in the smallest pieces of
                                        copy. In fact, copy elements such as calls to action, etc.
                                        are all considered "microcopy." The little snippets of instructions and help
                                        text that microcopy comprises
                                        differ from site to site, but written well it makes a big impact on usability.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="m-3">Thanks to stumbling onto a great article last May, <a class="blue"
                                            href="https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-build-a-better-product-with-ux-writing-926d78209ce8"

                                            "How to build a better product with UX writing"</a> I was already thinking
                                        about microcopy when my team started working on our final team project.
                                        While working on Bee-Z Street, I tried to improve user experience with some
                                        subtle tweaks to the buttons and images I added to the
                                        site's Registration and Contact pages. In the first draft, the buttons below
                                        were both labeled "Submit":
                                    </p>
                                    <span>
                                        <img class="img-fluid rounded border-secondary" src="../assets/images/bee_z_microcopy2.png"
                                            alt="responsive image microcopy examples" />
                                    </span>
                                    <p class="m-3">These buttons now more accurately reflect what users can expect when
                                        clicking them. Adding "Me" and "Your" also
                                        personalize the experience. In a real-world UX environment, we'd use <del>A/B
                                            testing</del>
                                        <a class="blue" href="https://uxstudioteam.com/ux-blog/ux-copywriting/" target="_blank">a
                                            cloze test, highlighter testing, or
                                            a comprehension survey</a> to see which version provides the best UX.
                                    </p>

                                        Button labels are just one microcopy element. But even this mini exercise
                                        helped me understand the importance of putting myself in the
                                        users' seat and ensuring every website element &mdash; no matter how small
                                        &mdash; is created with a great end-user experience in mind.
