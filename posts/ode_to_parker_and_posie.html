      <p>
        were rescue kittens I adopted in 2000. In the slideshow Parker is wearing the
        polka-dotted collar and Posie has the lion haircut. I'm sure that's not the official
        groomer name for her trim. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The other cats in the slideshow are rescues too. Lexie's the if-it-fits-I-sits cat, Ninja is the regal
        tuxedo, Kiko is the sassy Siamese, Pumpkin is the green-eyed robocat, and Snickers and Doodle are 
        "foster fails." They're big boys now and will be really embarrassed to know I used those pics. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Everybody is spayed and neutered, and nobody is allowed to
        go outside and eat birds. The mice who come inside, however, are fair game. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While this page is a tribute to my cats, it's also another step in my development journey. I wanted 
        to build a page without CDNs; this one uses flex box, CSS grid, and simple HTML. Not bad for a crazy 
        cat lady, amirite?

              </summary>
              <p>Parker was a lady<br />
              She always crossed her legs<br />
              And as the pretty sister<br />
              She never had to beg<br />
            </p>
            <p>She got the softest pillows<br />
              She had the freshest treats<br />
              And when it came to purring<br />
              She had her sister beat<br />
            </p>
            <p>Parker was a sweet girl<br />
              With fur between her toes<br />
              There never was a kitty<br />
              As cute as her in bows<br />

                Posie
                </summary>
                <p>Posie was a tomboy<br />
                She never combed her hair<br />
                Her voice was deep and husky<br />
                A cat? More like a bear!<br />
              </p>
              <p>Her fur was always messy<br />
                She was known to act bazaar <br />
                She loved to roll around<br />
                When I was playing my guitar<br />
              </p>
              <p>Posie was a sweet girl too<br />
                She had a nice long life<br />
                Both she and Parker taught me<br />
                Black cats are just divine<br />
