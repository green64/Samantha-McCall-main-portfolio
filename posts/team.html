                                real-world environment.
                                If you're lucky, they also help you discover soft skills you never knew you needed.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="mx-3 pt-3 portlink">This too is water</h3>
                            <p class="m-3">"There is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center
                                of." The brilliant man
                                who wrote those words is gone. But if you've never read or listened to David Foster
                                Wallace's commencement speech entitled
                                "<a class="blue" href="https://bit.ly/2KWQYDm" target="_blank">This is Water</a>,"
                                follow the link and skip this blog. His words are far more elucidating.


                                <p class="m-3">I've thought about the advice in that speech many times over the years,
                                    but the "learning how to think" part is
                                    especially relevant in the context of acquiring a new skill then using it
                                    successfully in a group of new
                                    developers. Every group project had coding, new JavaScript library, and clean,
                                    commented code guidelines ...
                                    But to truly succeed, teams also had to pool their ideas, creativity, and
                                    commitment. It was the soft skills &mdash; the
                                    "learn how to think and function as a team" factor &mdash; that often proved harder
                                    to deliver.</p>

                                <h3 class="mx-3 pt-3 portlink">The whiz-by factor of project 1</h3>
                                <p class="m-3">Project 1 in four words: "Did that just happen?" We definitely
                                    wrote code we weren't capable of nine weeks earlier, but the special sauce of
                                    communication with a dash of cooperation was
                                    missing. Two of our four-person group moved on to project 2; the others were sucked
                                    into the Matrix and vanished from class. For me, the lesson was
                                    a cautionary tale of the importance of follow-through and proactive
                                    problem-solving, which was probably more valuable than getting my API
                                    route to function.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="mx-3 pt-3 portlink">The getting-the-hang-of-it feel of project 2</h3>
                                <p class="m-3">Project 2 was our next chance to practice new skills and gel as a team.
                                    We'd all learned from
                                    the first round, and it was apparent in our project. Better time management, more
                                    confidence tackling new technologies, and
                                    an overall team-like approach helped us deliver <a class="blue" href="https://bit.ly/2u16BAi"
                                        target="_blank">Mindfully</a>,
                                    an app we were proud to present. We didn't quite finish, but in boot camp, like
                                    Broadway, the show must go on. And we did ... to project 3.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="mx-3 pt-3 portlink">The well-oiled efficiency of project 3</h3>
                                <p class="m-3">Maybe it was choosing our own team. Perhaps it was everyone's advanced
                                    full-stack skills. But I think the real secret to
                                    <a class="blue" href="https://bee-z-street.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Bee-Z
                                        Street's</a> success was our collective willingness and ability to work as a
                                    team. Strong, multi-channel communication. In-person sessions
                                    that let everyone flex their strengths. The ability to get back on track after a
                                    disagreement and refocus on the ultimate goal:
                                    a fully functioning, innovative showcase of four developers' talents.</p>

                                <p class="m-3">No one on our team hesitated to say yes to attending Demo Day and
                                    showing
                                    our work to other students and job prospects. Without question, we're better
                                    developers than we were 24 weeks ago. But now we're better team members too.
                                </p>
                                <h3 class="mx-3 pt-3 portlink">Success is about so much more than coding</h3>

                                        and everything to do with simple awareness; awareness of what is so real and

                                        plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding
